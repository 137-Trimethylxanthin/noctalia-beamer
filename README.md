# Kaffeehaus — Noctalia plugins for every Wayland compositor

A [Noctalia](https://noctalia.dev) **plugin source** — one room, a long menu.
Add it once and every plugin in here shows up in the Noctalia plugin store like
any other, updates included: a Win+P **display switcher**, a
**calendar** with month and day widgets, **picture-in-picture** for any
window or stream, a **Do Not Disturb** that actually keeps Discord quiet, and a
**spotlight** that puts a soft white glow around your cursor.

| [Vitrine](vitrine/README.md) | [Fiaker](fiaker/README.md) | [Häubchen](haeubchen/README.md) |

| Plugin | | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Vitrine](vitrine/README.md)** | `1.0.0` | A Win+P display switcher: extend, duplicate, external only and laptop only — from the launcher, a control-center tile, or one IPC call you can bind to your display key. Duplicate needs Hyprland. |
| **[Fiaker](fiaker/README.md)** | `0.1.2` | A calendar that keeps the month grid and the day timeline as separate, synchronized widgets, with a live now-line. |
| **[Häubchen](haeubchen/README.md)** | `0.2.0` | Picture-in-picture for any window or stream: pick it with `/pip` or one key, or let it spot streams itself, and it follows you into a corner whenever you leave its workspace. Hyprland, sway, Scroll, niri and MangoWC. |
| **[Goschen](goschen/README.md)** | `0.1.0` | Do Not Disturb that really means it: while it is on, the pings Discord, Telegram and friends play themselves are muted too, and the call you are in and your music keep playing. PipeWire. |
| **[Kerzenlicht](kerzenlicht/README.md)** | `0.1.0` | A spotlight for your cursor: a soft white glow follows it across every monitor, click-through, for screen shares, recordings and talks. Any compositor with cursor sessions. |

## Install

Add the source once:

```sh
noctalia msg plugins source add kaffeehaus git https://github.com/137-Trimethylxanthin/noctalia-kaffeehaus
```

Then enable whichever plugins you want:

```sh
noctalia msg plugins enable 137-trimethylxanthin/vitrine
noctalia msg plugins enable 137-trimethylxanthin/fiaker
noctalia msg plugins enable 137-trimethylxanthin/haeubchen
noctalia msg plugins enable 137-trimethylxanthin/goschen
noctalia msg plugins enable 137-trimethylxanthin/kerzenlicht
```

`source add` clones the repo into Noctalia's plugin cache; `enable` exports a
plugin and starts it. Both are also available in **Settings → Plugins**, where
`https://github.com/137-Trimethylxanthin/noctalia-kaffeehaus` goes in under
*Sources → Add*.

To pick up new versions later:

```sh
noctalia msg plugins update kaffeehaus
```

One source carries every plugin, so a single `update` covers everything in
here.

## Where they work

Noctalia runs on many Wayland compositors, and so do these plugins, as far as
each compositor lets a plugin do its job:

| | Hyprland | niri | Sway | Scroll | MangoWC | Labwc | dwl | River / Triad | Umbriel |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Vitrine** | ✅ | ☑️¹ | ☑️¹ | ☑️¹ | ☑️¹ | ☑️¹ | ☑️¹ | ☑️¹ | ☑️¹ |
| **Fiaker** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Häubchen** | ✅ | ☑️ | ☑️ | ☑️ | ☑️ | ❌² | ❌² | ❌² | ❌² |
| **Goschen** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Kerzenlicht** | ✅ | ☑️³ | ☑️⁴ | ☑️⁴ | ☑️⁴ | ☑️⁴ | ☑️⁴ | ☑️⁴ | ☑️⁴ |

✅ works (tested on Hyprland 0.56, or needs nothing from the compositor) ·
☑️ written against that compositor's IPC or protocol, not tested there yet ·
❌ not possible there

Vitrine and Häubchen 0.2 are new or reworked; on Hyprland their logic is
covered by the test suites, but the reworked versions have not yet been run in
a live Noctalia session.

1. Through the standard `wlr-output-management` protocol and `uv`. Everything
   but **Duplicate**: only Hyprland can mirror a screen.
2. These compositors give other programs no way to float, move or resize a
   window, which picture-in-picture needs. `/pip twitch …` still opens the
   player there, as a normal window, and Häubchen says so.
3. Needs a niri build newer than v26.04 (cursor sessions were merged on
   12 September 2026).
4. wlroots only reports the cursor while a monitor uses a hardware cursor; with
   a software cursor (`WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS=1`, nested sessions, some NVIDIA
   setups, a recording that paints the cursor in) the light goes out there.

Fiaker uses nothing but Noctalia's own widgets, and Goschen talks to PipeWire,
not to the compositor, which is why they work everywhere.

## Before you rely on them

**Vitrine** needs `hyprctl` on Hyprland, and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
everywhere else (it fetches pywayland on first use), and plugin API 24.

**Fiaker** ships empty until it has a source of events. Noctalia's plugin API
does not expose the built-in calendar, so the working backend is a directory of
`.ics` files — the layout `vdirsyncer` produces. Set **vdir path** in
**Settings → Plugins → Fiaker** to that directory.

**Häubchen** needs `hyprctl` and `socat` on Hyprland, `swaymsg` on sway,
`scrollmsg` on Scroll, `niri` and `socat` on niri, or `mmsg` on MangoWC. Opening
a stream in its own player also needs one — mpv with `yt-dlp` by default.
Following a window you already have open does not.

**Goschen** needs PipeWire with WirePlumber, plus `pactl` and `pacat`
(`libpulse` / `pulseaudio-utils`). It mutes per app, not per sound, so an app
in a call keeps its pings along with the call.

**Kerzenlicht** needs `uv` (it fetches pywayland on first use), `pkill` and
`pgrep`, and a compositor with `ext-image-copy-capture-v1` cursor sessions.

Each plugin's own README has the full documentation — every widget, setting and
caveat.

## Repository layout

```
vitrine/          a plugin; this is what Noctalia exports
fiaker/, …        the others
  plugin.toml     manifest: id, entries, metadata
  *.luau          entry scripts
  lib/            shared modules
  translations/   label_key / description_key strings
  README.md       the plugin's page in the store
  thumbnail.webp  its card image
  screenshots/    README images, where a plugin has more than the card
tests/            pure-logic tests, per plugin; not shipped to Noctalia
catalog.toml      source index; regenerated by CI on every push
```

Every plugin is one top-level directory holding a `plugin.toml`. Adding another
one is exactly that — a new directory; CI picks it up with no configuration.

`catalog.toml` is what makes the git route work: Noctalia reads it to render and
compat-check the source before cloning anything else. It is generated from every
`*/plugin.toml` by `.github/workflows/update-catalog.py` and committed, so
bumping `version` in a manifest is all a release takes. To regenerate it by hand:

```sh
uv run .github/workflows/update-catalog.py
```

## Developing

Point Noctalia at your checkout instead of at GitHub — a `path` source is scanned
directly, with no catalog involved, and `.luau` edits hot-reload:

```sh
noctalia msg plugins source add dev path ~/Documents/code/noctalia-kaffeehaus
noctalia plugins lint vitrine
noctalia plugins lint fiaker
noctalia plugins lint haeubchen
noctalia plugins lint goschen
noctalia plugins lint kerzenlicht
./tests/vitrine/run.sh
./tests/fiaker/run.sh
./tests/haeubchen/run.sh
./tests/goschen/run.sh
./tests/kerzenlicht/run.sh
```
